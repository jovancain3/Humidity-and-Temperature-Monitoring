# Humidity-and-Temperature-Monitoring

As it was constantly warmer in my room than the rest of my apartment, I decided to test my theory by constructing this temperature and humidity monitor. It records the current temperature and humidity of your surroudings, and not the outside weather. This was a simple yet useful project in helping me solve a problem.

### Materials
__________
- Arduino Uno Board
- DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor
- LCD Screen
- Wires
- 220 Ohm Resistor
- 10k Potentiometer

### Theory
_________
The DHT11 measures relative humidity. Relative humidity is the amount of water vapor in air vs. the saturation point of water vapor in air.The DHT11 detects water vapor by measuring the electrical resistance between two electrodes. The change in resistance between the two electrodes is proportional to the relative humidity. Higher relative humidity decreases the resistance between the electrodes, while lower relative humidity increases the resistance between the electrodes. The DHT11 measures temperature with a surface mounted NTC temperature sensor (thermistor) built into the unit.
